## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#Question 1:
#A The null hypothesis is that there is no statistically significant difference in fish catch before and after the oil spills. The alternate hypothesis isthat there is a statistically significant reduced amount of fish catch after the oil spill than before the oil spill
```

```{r}
#B 
fishcatch=data.frame(fishcatch2)
fishcatch
```

```{r}
data.frame(fishcatch)
difference=(fishcatch$X2009.catch-fishcatch$X2010.catch)
hist(difference, xlab='Amount decrease in fishcatch between 2009 and 2010', ylab='Frequency',main='The frequency of the amount of fish loss across all villages') 
```

```{r}

```
