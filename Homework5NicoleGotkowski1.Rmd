## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
install.packages('rpart.plot')

```


```{r}
my.data=crimedata

summary(my.data)
```

```{r}
#Trainset
set.seed(47)
train<-sample(x = nrow(m), size = 12, replace = FALSE)
train.data <- my.data[sample(x = nrow(my.data), size = 47, replace = FALSE),] 
```

```{r}
#Building regression tree with training set
m.rpart=rpart(CrimeRate~ ExpenditureYear, BelowWage,StateSize, Education, MatureUnemployment, YouthUnemployment, data = train.data)
```

```{r}
m.rpart=rpart(train.data$CrimeRate~ train.data$ExpenditureYear, train.data$BelowWage,train.data$StateSize, train.data$Education, train.data$MatureUnemployment, train.data$YouthUnemployment, data = train.data)
```
```{r}
m.rpart=rpart(train.data$CrimeRate~ . , data = train.data)
```


```{r}
#summary of tree
summary(m.rpart)
rpart.plot(m.rpart, digits = 3, fallen.leaves = TRUE,tweak=1.3)
```
