## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Question 1
```{r}
transA=c(0.17,0.20,0.13,0.20,0.24,0.25,0.15,0.21,0.21)
transB=c(0.71,0.21,0.34,0.32,0.33,0.29,0.18,0.20,0.25)

```



#Question2

```{r}
mean(transA)-mean(transB)

```


#Question3
```{r}
mean(commonstrain)-mean(transA)
```

#Question4
```{r}
hist(commonstrain)
```

#Question5
```{r}
Peroxide=c(0.27,0.21,0.34,0.32,0.24,0.29,0.18,0.20,0.29)
Growth.rate=c(1.79,1.01,1.71,1.89,1.41,1.15,1.13,1.20,1.10)
```

#Question6
```{r}
mydat=data.frame('X'=Peroxide ,'Y'=Growth.rate)
plot(mydat$X,mydat$Y)
plot(mydat$X,mydat$Y,xlab='Hydrogen peroxide concentration (Î¼moles/g)',ylab='Fungal growth rate (cm/day)',main='Hydrogen Peroxide Concentration and Fungal Growth Rate')
```

#Question7
#The hypothesis is incorrect. Fungal growth increases with increasing hydrogen peroxide concentration.

#PartII


#Question9
```{r}
my.dat=read.csv("Seaturtles2.csv")
my.table=table(my.dat$Nesting.Status,my.dat$Species)
my.table
```

#Question10

```{r}
barplot(my.table,main="Amount of Successes and Abortions for Each Seaturtle",xlab="Turtle Species",ylab="Amount of Eggs Laid",col=c('red','green'),beside=TRUE)
```

#Question11
```{r}
mean(my.table[2,])
sd(my.table[2,])
```
#Question12
```{r}
prop.table(my.table)
```
Olive.Ridley has the highest abortion rate, therefore, I would chose this species to focus conservation events on. 

#Question13
```{r}
my.data=read.csv('Turtlesurvival.csv')
```

#Question14
```{r}
boxplot(my.data$Mean.Eggs~my.data$Species,xlab="Turtle Species",ylab="Mean Number of Eggs Per Site", main="Mean Number of Eggs Laid per Nesting Site")
```
#qUESTION15
```{r}
plot(subset(my.data,my.data$Species=="Leatherback")[,2]~subset(my.data,my.data$Species=="Hawksbill")[,2],main='Hawksbill Eggs and Leatherback Eggs Per All 16 Nesting Sites',ylab="Hawksbill",xlab="Leatherback Eggs")
